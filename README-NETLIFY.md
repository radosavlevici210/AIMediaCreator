## Netlify Deployment

### 1. Quick Deploy
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/radosavlevici210/AIMediaCreator)

### 2. Manual Deployment

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your forked repository

3. **Build Settings**
   ```
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: dist
   Functions directory: netlify/functions
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   Set these in Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

### 3. Custom Build Process

The project includes optimized build scripts:

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build for Netlify
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run check
```

## Architecture

### Frontend (Static)
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build optimization
- Progressive Web App features

### Backend (Serverless)
- Express.js on Netlify Functions
- In-memory storage with persistence options
- RESTful API architecture
- Real-time WebSocket support

### Security Features
- Content Security Policy headers
- CORS protection
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- Helmet.js security middleware

## Performance Optimizations

### Build Optimizations
- Tree-shaking for minimal bundle size
- Code splitting for faster loading
- Asset optimization and compression
- CDN integration via Netlify

### Runtime Optimizations
- Lazy loading components
- Memoization for expensive operations
- Efficient state management
- WebSocket connection pooling

## API Endpoints

All API routes are available under `/api/`:

- `GET /api/stats` - Project statistics
- `GET /api/performance` - Performance metrics
- `GET /api/security` - Security logs
- `GET /api/router-status` - Connection status
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects

## Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Access at http://localhost:5000
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Test built application
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node.js version (20+ required)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript errors

2. **Function Timeout**
   - Netlify functions have 10s timeout
   - Optimize long-running operations
   - Consider background processing

3. **CORS Issues**
   - Verify domain configuration
   - Check environment variables
   - Update CORS settings in netlify/functions/api.js

### Monitoring

Monitor your deployment at:
- Netlify Dashboard for deployment logs
- Function logs for serverless debugging
- Performance metrics in the app dashboard

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Netlify deploy logs
2. Review function execution logs
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Check browser console for client-side errors

## Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit sensitive data
   - Use Netlify environment variables
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Content Security**
   - CSP headers configured
   - Input sanitization enabled
   - XSS protection active

3. **Access Control**
   - Rate limiting implemented
   - Authentication ready
   - Role-based permissions
